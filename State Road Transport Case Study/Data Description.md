## ðŸ§¾ Data Description

The project utilizes publicly available datasets from **State Road Transport Undertakings (SRTUs)** in India, sourced from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/). These datasets are provided in **multiple formats** representing different types of information:

### ðŸ“‚ File Types & Contents

| Format | File Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| ðŸ“„ CSV   | Structured   | Profit & Loss data for SRTUs |
| ðŸ§¾ JSON  | Semi-Structured | Financial performance data (e.g., income, expenses) |
| ðŸ—‚ XML   | Semi-Structured | Physical data (e.g., number of buses, kilometers operated) |

### ðŸ§  Key Attributes Across Datasets

- `State_Name`: Name of the state
- `Year`: Reporting year
- `Total_Revenue`: Total income/revenue (from JSON)
- `Operating_Expenses`: Costs incurred (from JSON)
- `Net_Profit_Loss`: Profit or loss (from CSV)
- `No_of_Buses`: Physical asset count (from XML)
- `Distance_Covered`: Kilometers run (from XML)

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Column names were cleaned and standardized during transformation to ensure consistency across all formats.
